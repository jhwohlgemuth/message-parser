RMKS/1.  Midterm elections are approaching soon.  The campaign season is in 
full swing.  This is our democratic process in action, and an important and 
vibrant part of being Americans; it's important that we all vote.  The 
Federal Voting Assistance Program works to ensure all service members who 
want to vote have the tools and resources to successfully do so from anywhere 
in the world.

2.  It's also important that as we participate in the democratic process, we 
do so in a way that preserves the military's longstanding posture of being 
non-political.
As members of the Navy, we cannot give the perception that we sponsor, 
endorse, or approve any political candidate, campaign, or cause.  This is 
also an important part of our democracy - we do not have a politically 
partisan military.

3.  The Navy and the Department of Defense (DoD) have clear policies that 
help us strike the right balance between our right and obligation to vote, 
while not engaging in any prohibited political activities.  These policies 
support and enable a fair political process by prohibiting the use of Navy 
and DoD installations and facilities for political activities by candidates 
running for office.  As well, we must behave in a way that avoids the 
perception of Navy or DoD sponsorship, approval, or endorsement.
For instance, we must not wear our uniforms in connection with any political 
activities, such as attendance at any political event.

4.  This message lists a number of references that can help you determine the 
right course of action regarding your participation in our democratic 
process.  Please consult them closely as you exercise your right to vote.  If 
you have any questions, please contact your command's Voting Officer, your 
command's Legal Officer, your Public Affairs Officer, your chain of command, 
or the public affairs contact listed below.

5.  Public affairs points of contact:  Ms. Jennifer Ivey, OI-5, Director, 
Strategy, Plans, and Assessments at (703) 693-3569 or email:
