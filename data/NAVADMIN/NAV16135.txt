SUBJ:  MASTER CHIEF PETTY OFFICER OF THE NAVY SELECTION//

RMKS/1.  It is my pleasure to announce that Admiral Richardson has selected 
FLTCM(IDW/SG/SW) Steven S. Giordano to serve as the next Master Chief Petty 
Officer of the Navy (MCPON).  He will relieve me 2 September 2016 during a 
ceremony at the Washington Navy Yard.

2.  FLTCM Giordano is eminently qualified to serve as the 14th MCPON of our 
great Navy.  He was selected from a distinguished group of senior flag-level 
Command Master Chiefs (CMC), all of whom truly personify the virtues and high 
standards we demand from Navy leadership.  Currently assigned as Fleet Master 
Chief, U.S. Naval Forces Europe-Africa, he brings a wealth of experience, 
including previous CMC tours onboard USS MCCLUSKY (FFG 41), Navy Information 
Operations Command Colorado, and Navy Information Dominance Forces and is 
undoubtedly equipped to tackle the issues affecting our Navy in the coming 
years.

3.  I look forward to working with FLTCM Giordano over the next few months on 
the issues critical to maintaining maritime superiority.

4.  MCPON Stevens sends.
